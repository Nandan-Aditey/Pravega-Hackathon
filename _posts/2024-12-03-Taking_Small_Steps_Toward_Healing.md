Depression can make it feel like you’re stuck in a never-ending cycle, unable to move forward. But healing doesn’t happen in giant leaps—it happens in small steps. If you’re struggling to get out of that dark place, here’s a simple approach to get started:

Start with One Thing – When everything feels overwhelming, choose one small action you can take. This could be as simple as making your bed in the morning or stepping outside for five minutes of fresh air. Completing small tasks can help build momentum.

Celebrate Your Progress – It’s easy to dismiss progress when it feels insignificant. But every step forward is a victory. Celebrate the moments when you manage to do something, no matter how small. Progress is progress.

Practice Gratitude – Even on your darkest days, find something to be grateful for. It might be as simple as a warm cup of tea or a conversation with a friend. Gratitude helps shift the focus from what’s wrong to what’s right, no matter how small.

Remember, healing isn’t linear. Be patient with yourself and allow room for setbacks. Each step, no matter how small, is a step toward feeling better.
