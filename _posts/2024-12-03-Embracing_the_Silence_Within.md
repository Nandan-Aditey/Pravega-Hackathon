When depression weighs heavily on your heart, it can often feel like you’re drowning in a sea of noise. You may try to escape the chaos by silencing your emotions, but what if, instead of escaping, you embraced that silence?

The first step is acknowledging that silence isn’t always peaceful. In fact, silence can sometimes be the loudest form of avoidance. But if you sit quietly with your thoughts, without judgment or resistance, you might find something incredibly important: self-compassion.

Here’s what I recommend:

Take Five Minutes Each Day – Find a quiet space, away from distractions, and just breathe. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Let your thoughts flow without trying to control them. Acknowledge what you're feeling, without judgment.

Journal Your Thoughts – Writing can be a form of release. Pour out your emotions on paper without worrying about structure. It's a safe space for your feelings.

Practice Self-Compassion – When thoughts of guilt or shame arise, remind yourself that it's okay to feel the way you do. Be kind to yourself as you would be to a friend in the same situation.

Sometimes, it’s not about fixing the silence but learning to understand and live with it. In that quiet moment, you might just find the answers you’ve been searching for.
