            <p>Mental Health is an important aspect of our lives. It is the foundation of our well-being, and that is why we must take care of it just like our physical health. 

                In most parts of the country, mental health is still a taboo subject. People are afraid to talk about it, and they are afraid to seek help. This is why we have created this platform. A website where people can learn how to handle their mental health issues and avail help. We offer FREE therapy to anyone who needs it. You are just a click away from getting the help you need.
                
                In case of any emergency, such as suicidal thoughts, or panic attacks, we provide a 24/7 helpline number. You can call us anytime, and we will be there to help you.
                
                Our team consists of three depressed BTech students who are trying to make a difference in the world. We have been through a lot, and we know how it feels to be alone. We don't want anyone to feel the same way. And that is why we are here. We made this website for ourselves, asking therapists all over the world, who would want to join and make a difference.
                
                This website is made by students, for students. <br><br>
